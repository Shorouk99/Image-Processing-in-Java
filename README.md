# Image-Processing-in-Java
Image processing using kernel filters. The class is completely implemented in java

The class contains the following filters as objects: 
- Identity filter
- Gaussian blur filter
- Sharpen filter
- Laplacian filter
- Emboss filter
- Motion blur filter

### The following are examples of some filters applied on the traditional image-processing-baboon image
